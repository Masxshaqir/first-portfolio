                                extensive Baltic Sea archipelago. The cobblestone streets and ochre-colored buildings of
                                Gamla Stan (the old town) are home to the 13th-century Storkyrkan Cathedral, the
                                Kungliga Slottet Royal Palace and the Nobel Museum, which focuses on the Nobel Prize.
                                Ferries and sightseeing boats shuttle passengers between the islands.</p>
